# Q12025_Finding_Future_Asset_Allocation
Monte Carlo simulations to explore ideal asset allocations (data through the end of 2024)

I was thinking about my asset allocation and the recent, relatively high valuation of the NASDAQ and S&P 500 indexes. I decided to do Monte Carlo simulations of possible future returns. The data, results and process are included in .csv, source code, a Jupyter notebook, and a markdown file.

You will need to set up a compatible environment and run the code. I used the versions, below, but the most up-to-date versions should also work:
Python 3.12.3
pandas 2.2.3
numpy 2.2.2
matplotlib 3.10.0
seaborn 0.13.2
statsmodels 0.14.4
