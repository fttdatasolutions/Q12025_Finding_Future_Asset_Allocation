    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAPE Ratio (Cyclically Adjusted Price to Earnings Ratio) is a valuation measurement, developed by Robert Shiller, that compares an asset’s current price to the average of the asset’s annualized earnings over the prior 10 years. Here is a visual for the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    " - CAPE = Price / (SUM(10 prior years of earnings) / 10 years)\n",
    "\n",
    "Shiller’s purpose for developing, tracking, and analyzing this metric was/is to find a data-driven answer to a problematic question in finance: Does an asset’s price definitively impact the asset’s future returns? One should read Shiller’s papers and the deluge of subsequent academic studies, for further answers to that question. In this project, I will use Shiller’s data and build on his and others’ work to answer a different question: What asset allocation should I use, in the 1st quarter of 2025, to optimize my portfolio’s return over the next 10 years?\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will answer this question with a Bayesian approach, meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The answer will be a probability distribution.\n",
    "    2. New data will update the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will not use strict Bayesian modeling, but will use Bayesian principles as a foundational guide. The project will use Python as a scripting language and will use source data from Robert Shiller’s data repository, Aswath Damodoran’s data repository, and portfoliovizualizer.com (all of whose citations for their data sources are on each respective website). The data covers annual returns, CAPE valuation at end-of-year, and annual inflation from the beginning of 1928 through the end of 2024:\n"

    "We’re not shocked to see that an increase in SP500 valuation (represented by positive CAPE delta) leads to increased SP500 returns $-$ that was a pretty safe assumption. What’s more interesting, is that 10_yr_T is quite positively affected by CAPE delta, but with a wide error margin and a small scale (see the scale on the y-axis of the green chart, and compare it to scale of the blue SP500 chart); Gold appears quite negatively impacted by rising CAPE; SCV seems much more affected by starting CAPE than CAPE delta. These are important distinctions to make, since they show the importance of weighting our upcoming calculations, to account for our relatively high starting CAPE ratio (37.77)."

    "We’re now going to model possible future return distributions, in order to answer our primary objective: to measure subsequent distribution of possible 10-year performances of our 4 asset classes, given correlations “C”, the average return of each asset class, and the data provided above. To achieve this, we will use Monte Carlo simulations. Monte Carlo is a process of \n",
    " - (a) Sampling our data; we’ll use a parameter called “replacement,” meaning we might reuse data points multiple times in each sample. We’ll average those samples in groups of 10 years, and add the averages into a new dataset. \n",
    " - (b) Perform (a) thousands of times\n",
    " - (c) Visualize the average returns of each (a), which will let us see a “distribution of distributions.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll keep a few principles in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Since we’re sampling thousands of times, our model will already account for the average return of each asset class (further reading: the Central Limit Theorem), but retain the randomness of each year’s return.\n",
    "    2. Correlations “C” are the average correlations of our assets over time. These correlations will be different in each sample and resample. Again, since we’re doing this thousands of times, our Correlations should closely resemble “C.”\n",
    "    3. We need to account for our starting CAPE being high. We’ll add a CAPE_percentage column for each year, and add preference for when CAPEs were in the top quartile of cumulative valuations (so, in the top quartile, as of the year records - not the top quartile of all time). This point is really important - we’ll visualize these results against unfiltered results, to see the difference that starting CAPE makes."

Regardless, in every simulation I ran, P2 comes out with the highest mean and minimum cumulative returns. Frequently, the risk of a modeled portfolio is measured by its variance or standard deviation; in this scenario, I want to use the minimum for measuring risk, since the minimum measures our worst expected outcome. In the most recent scenario I ran, P2’s minimum was calculated at 1.36362, meaning P2 gained 136.362% on top of its original value (ex: a portfolio that started with \\$10,000 would end up with \\$23,636.2 in this scenario - an ~8.98% average annual return!). This is quite a good result and much higher than I expected; I expected lower returns, when measuring portfolios that started with a relatively high SP 500 CAPE ratio.
